The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

The props will be merged in the order the `StatusBar` components were\n * mounted. One use case is to specify status bar styles per route using `Navigator`.\n *\n * ```\n *  <View>\n *    <StatusBar\n *      backgroundColor=\"blue\"\n *      barStyle=\"light-content\"\n *    />\n *    <Navigator\n *      initialRoute={{statusBarHidden: true}}\n *      renderScene={(route, navigator) =>\n *        <View>\n *          <StatusBar hidden={route.statusBarHidden} />\n *          ...\n *        </View>\n *      }\n *    />\n *  </View>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Imperative API\n *\n * For cases where using a component is not ideal, there are static methods\n * to manipulate the `StatusBar` display stack. These methods have the same\n * behavior as mounting and unmounting a `StatusBar` component.\n *\n * For example, you can call `StatusBar.pushStackEntry` to update the status bar\n * before launching a third-party native UI component, and then call\n * `StatusBar.popStackEntry` when completed.\n *\n * ```\n * const openThirdPartyBugReporter = async () => {\n *   // The bug reporter has a dark background, so we push a new status bar style.\n *   const stackEntry = StatusBar.pushStackEntry({barStyle: 'light-content'});\n *\n *   // `open` returns a promise that resolves when the UI is dismissed.\n *   await BugReporter.open();\n *\n *   // Don't forget to call `popStackEntry` when you're done.\n *   StatusBar.popStackEntry(stackEntry);\n * };\n * ```\n *\n * There is a legacy imperative API that enables you to manually update the\n * status bar styles. However, the legacy API does not update the internal\n * `StatusBar` display stack, which means that any changes will be overridden\n * whenever a `StatusBar` component is mounted or unmounted.\n *\n * It is strongly advised that you use `pushStackEntry`, `popStackEntry`, or\n * `replaceStackEntry` instead of the static methods beginning with `set`.\n *\n * ### Constants\n *\n * `currentHeight` (Android only) The height of the status bar.\n */\nclass StatusBar extends React.Component<Props> {\n  static _propsStack = [];\n\n  static _defaultProps = createStackEntry({\n    animated: false,\n    showHideTransition: 'fade',\n    backgroundColor: Platform.select({\n      android: StatusBarManager.DEFAULT_BACKGROUND_COLOR ??

Props provide configurability for several features, such as\n * auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard\n * types, such as a numeric keypad.\n *\n * The simplest use case is to plop down a `TextInput` and subscribe to the\n * `onChangeText` events to read the user input. There are also other events,\n * such as `onSubmitEditing` and `onFocus` that can be subscribed to. A simple\n * example:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = { text: 'Useless Placeholder' };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}}\n *         onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *         value={this.state.text}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip this line if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => UselessTextInput);\n * ```\n *\n * Two methods exposed via the native element are .focus() and .blur() that\n * will focus or blur the TextInput programmatically.\n *\n * Note that some props are only available with `multiline={true/false}`.\n * Additionally, border styles that apply to only one side of the element\n * (e.g., `borderBottomColor`, `borderLeftWidth`, etc.) will not be applied if\n * `multiline=false`. To achieve the same effect, you can wrap your `TextInput`\n * in a `View`:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, View, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         {...this.props} // Inherit any props passed to it; e.g., multiline, numberOfLines below\n *         editable = {true}\n *         maxLength = {40}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInputMultiline extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = {\n *       text: 'Useless Multiline Placeholder',\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   // If you type something in the text box that is a color, the background will change to that\n *   // color.\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *      <View style={{\n *        backgroundColor: this.state.text,\n *        borderBottomColor: '#000000',\n *        borderBottomWidth: 1 }}\n *      >\n *        <UselessTextInput\n *          multiline = {true}\n *          numberOfLines = {4}\n *          onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *          value={this.state.text}\n *        />\n *      </View>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip these lines if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent(\n *  'AwesomeProject',\n *  () => UselessTextInputMultiline\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * `TextInput` has by default a border at the bottom of its view. This border\n * has its padding set by the background image provided by the system, and it\n * cannot be changed.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *

Check out this\n * [blog post](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/better-list-views.html)\n * for more details.\n *\n * ListView - A core component designed for efficient display of vertically\n * scrolling lists of changing data. The minimal API is to create a\n * [`ListView.DataSource`](docs/listviewdatasource.html), populate it with a simple\n * array of data blobs, and instantiate a `ListView` component with that data\n * source and a `renderRow` callback which takes a blob from the data array and\n * returns a renderable component.\n *\n * Minimal example:\n *\n * ```\n * class MyComponent extends Component {\n *   constructor() {\n *     super();\n *     const ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) => r1 !== r2});\n *     this.state = {\n *       dataSource: ds.cloneWithRows(['row 1', 'row 2']),\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <ListView\n *         dataSource={this.state.dataSource}\n *         renderRow={(rowData) => <Text>{rowData}</Text>}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ListView also supports more advanced features, including sections with sticky\n * section headers, header and footer support, callbacks on reaching the end of\n * the available data (`onEndReached`) and on the set of rows that are visible\n * in the device viewport change (`onChangeVisibleRows`), and several\n * performance optimizations.\n *\n * There are a few performance operations designed to make ListView scroll\n * smoothly while dynamically loading potentially very large (or conceptually\n * infinite) data sets:\n *\n *  * Only re-render changed rows - the rowHasChanged function provided to the\n *    data source tells the ListView if it needs to re-render a row because the\n *    source data has changed - see ListViewDataSource for more details.\n *\n *  * Rate-limited row rendering - By default, only one row is rendered per\n *    event-loop (customizable with the `pageSize` prop). This breaks up the\n *    work into smaller chunks to reduce the chance of dropping frames while\n *    rendering rows.\n */\n\nconst ListView = createReactClass({\n  displayName: 'ListView',\n  _rafIds: ([]: Array<AnimationFrameID>),\n  _childFrames: ([]: Array<Object>),\n  _sentEndForContentLength: (null: ?number),\n  _scrollComponent: (null: ?React.ElementRef<typeof ScrollView>),\n  _prevRenderedRowsCount: 0,\n  _visibleRows: ({}: Object),\n  scrollProperties: ({}: Object),\n\n  mixins: [ScrollResponder.Mixin],\n\n  statics: {\n    DataSource: ListViewDataSource,\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Exports some data, e.g. for perf investigations or analytics.\n   */\n  getMetrics: function() {\n    return {\n      contentLength: this.scrollProperties.contentLength,\n      totalRows: this.props.enableEmptySections\n        ? this.props.dataSource.getRowAndSectionCount()\n        : this.props.dataSource.getRowCount(),\n      renderedRows: this.state.curRenderedRowsCount,\n      visibleRows: Object.keys(this._visibleRows).length,\n    };\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Provides a handle to the underlying scroll responder.\n   * Note that `this._scrollComponent` might not be a `ScrollView`, so we\n   * need to check that it responds to `getScrollResponder` before calling it.\n   */\n  getScrollResponder: function() {\n    if (this._scrollComponent && this._scrollComponent.getScrollResponder) {\n      return this._scrollComponent.getScrollResponder();\n    }\n  },\n\n  getScrollableNode: function() {\n    if (this._scrollComponent && this._scrollComponent.getScrollableNode) {\n      return this._scrollComponent.getScrollableNode();\n    } else {\n      return ReactNative.findNodeHandle(this._scrollComponent);\n    }\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Scrolls to a given x, y offset, either immediately or with a smooth animation.\n   *\n   * See `ScrollView#scrollTo`.\n   */\n  scrollTo: function(...args: any) {\n    if (this._scrollComponent && this._scrollComponent.scrollTo) {\n      this._scrollComponent.scrollTo(...args);\n    }\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * If this is a vertical ListView scrolls to the bottom.\n   * If this is a horizontal ListView scrolls to the right.\n   *\n   * Use `scrollToEnd({animated: true})` for smooth animated scrolling,\n   * `scrollToEnd({animated: false})` for immediate scrolling.\n   * If no options are passed, `animated` defaults to true.\n   *\n   * See `ScrollView#scrollToEnd`.\n   */\n  scrollToEnd: function(options?: ?{animated?: boolean}) {\n    if (this._scrollComponent) {\n      if (this._scrollComponent.scrollToEnd) {\n        this._scrollComponent.scrollToEnd(options);\n      } else {\n        console.warn(\n          'The scroll component used by the ListView does not support ' +\n            'scrollToEnd.

The window adapts to scrolling behavior, and items\n * are rendered incrementally with low-pri (after any running interactions) if they are far from the\n * visible area, or with hi-pri otherwise to minimize the potential of seeing blank space.\n *\n * Some caveats:\n *\n * - Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\nclass VirtualizedList extends React.PureComponent<Props, State> {\n  props: Props;\n\n  // scrollToEnd may be janky without getItemLayout prop\n  scrollToEnd(params?: ?{animated?: ?boolean}) {\n    const animated = params ? params.animated : true;\n    const veryLast = this.props.getItemCount(this.props.data) - 1;\n    const frame = this._getFrameMetricsApprox(veryLast);\n    const offset = Math.max(\n      0,\n      frame.offset +\n        frame.length +\n        this._footerLength -\n        this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength,\n    );\n    /* $FlowFixMe(>=0.53.0 site=react_native_fb,react_native_oss) This comment\n     * suppresses an error when upgrading Flow's support for React.

But, ultimately the physical display only\n * have a fixed number of pixels, for example 640×960 for iPhone 4 or 750×1334\n * for iPhone 6. iOS tries to be as faithful as possible to the user value by\n * spreading one original pixel into multiple ones to trick the eye. The\n * downside of this technique is that it makes the resulting element look\n * blurry.\n *\n * In practice, we found out that developers do not want this feature and they\n * have to work around it by doing manual rounding in order to avoid having\n * blurry elements. In React Native, we are rounding all the pixels\n * automatically.\n *\n * We have to be careful when to do this rounding. You never want to work with\n * rounded and unrounded values at the same time as you're going to accumulate\n * rounding errors. Having even one rounding error is deadly because a one\n * pixel border may vanish or be twice as big.\n *\n * In React Native, everything in JavaScript and within the layout engine works\n * with arbitrary precision numbers. It's only when we set the position and\n * dimensions of the native element on the main thread that we round. Also,\n * rounding is done relative to the root rather than the parent, again to avoid\n * accumulating rounding errors.\n *\n */\nclass PixelRatio {\n  /**\n   * Returns the device pixel density.
